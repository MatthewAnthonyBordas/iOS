# WOX
WOX is a machine learning project I developed for a class at UC Davis. We created a neural network to evaluate San Francisco walking routes with a safety score by learning from past crime data. I built this iOS app to showcase our neural networkâ€™s results by using an MKMapView to render the routes as MKPolyline overlays. The routes are a custom class with an array of CLLocationCoordinate2D points filled from the latitudes and longitudes of steps along the route. On each route there is an MKAnnotation showing the safety score.
